# lita-image
Blatant rip off of lita-doge and lita-applause. I mixed the two together, changed the images, and changed the applause pattern to be a command.

## Installation

WIP. Intend to put this on rubygems

## Configuration

There are no required configurations.

## Usage

Applause will trigger whenever the following are said:

```
lita applause
lita applaud
lita slow clap
lita bravo
```

Doges will come to you when the following is said:


```
lita doge me
```

And if you wish to sensibly chuckle:

```
lita chuckle
```

If something is bretty good

```
lita 5/5
```
